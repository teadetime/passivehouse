# Passive Solar House

Below is an intro to this project, please look at **[our report](/docs/report_code.pdf)** to see our code and work.

## Introduction and Background
#### What is a passive solar home?
Passive solar houses are incredible. By definition passive solar houses they use energy from the sun and their surroundings to maintain a livable internal temperature. Everyone should be interested in building one as passive homes are much cheaper to heat and cool since they are designed in such a way to naturally maintain reasonable temperatures. 

Passive solar homes are built on the principle of storing energy from the sun. At a base level they require: 
- A large thermal mass (like stone floors) to store energy from the sun
- Large south facing windows to collect sun, specifically in the winter months
- Some form of insulation to reduce heat loss
- Other controls/design choices to block sun in certain situations (eaves, trees, etc)

#### What's our strategy?
Designing a passive solar house for the Boston area where it gets very cold in the winter will require careful design of the house. In attempt to maintain a stable internal temperature, our first model/design will incorporate the following features:
- Extremely large south facing window
- Eaves that protect the windows/thermal mass during the summer
- A tile floor that act's as a large thermal mass
- No windows in any other walls
- A very tiny floorplan (~200sqft)
- Insulation in the ceiling, walls, and floor
